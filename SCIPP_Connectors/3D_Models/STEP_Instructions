This folder contains STEP file 3D models of Samtec connectors used on the termination boards. If the models aren't automatically grouped with the appropriate connectors for 3D display, then follow these steps to link the STEP files with the connector file.

Open KiCad
Open Footprint Editor
Select SCIPP_Connector folder
    If this folder doesn't appear, import it using the Add Library function under the File tab within the Footprint Editor appear
Double click on the footprint to add a 3D model to (SLH/TLH 10/20 pin, or UMPS/UMPT all available)
Under the Edit tab, select Footprint Properties editor 
Select the 3D Settings tab at the top of the new window
Click the folder icon midway down the page to import a new 3D model for the connector footprint
Select a path from the dropdown menu closest to the point of download for the repository
Select one of the STEP 3D models included within the 3D_Models folder of this repository corresponding to the selected footprint
    For example, TLH footprint is the 10 pin option, using the TLH-010-0.50-G-D-A-K.stp file 
Once the file is imported, it may require additional adjustments using the X/Y/Z offsets (usually in .5 mm increments)
Click OK at the bottom of the Footprint Properties window
Under the View tab, select the 3D Viewer to create a popup window for the 3D model
Rotate and inspect the connector to make sure the import was successful and properly aligned
Save changes using the Save buttion in the top left corner of the original Footprint Editor window
Update existing footprints in the PCB editor with this updated footprint to propagate changes made here to full PCB 3D models

STEP files map to footprints in the following way.

TLH-010-0.50-G-D-A.stp   -->   TLH(mp)
TLH-020-0.50-G-D-A.stp   -->   TLH_20_Pin
HV TLH-010-0.50-G-D-A.stp  -->   19-1_TLH_HV

SLH-010-1.50-G-D-A.stp     -->   SLH(mp)
SLH-020-1.50-G-D-A.stp     -->   SLH_20_Pin
HV SLH-010-1.50-G-D-A.stp  -->   19-1_SLH_HV

UMPS-05-03.5-G-VT-SM-WT.stp -->   UMPS_5_Pin
UMPT-05-01.5-G-VT-SM-WT.stp   -->   UMPT_5_Pin

The following files are included as alternatives which include polyamide pick and place dots (K) which will be used during PCB population.

TLH-010-0.50-G-D-A-K.stp
TLH-020-0.50-G-D-A-K.stp 
UMPS-05-03.5-G-VT-SM-WT-K.stp
